The bottom ends of the legs are flat and parallel, forming a rectangular base. The overall shape resembles an inverted "U" or a staple, with a consistent thickness throughout. The corners at the top are rounded, while the bottom edges are sharp and flat. The component appears to be symmetric and rigid, likely used for linking or holding other parts together.'
