The horizontal base is elongated and flat, with a cylindrical pivot pin protruding downward near one end, and a small cylindrical stop or peg extending upward from the top surface. The vertical arm rises perpendicularly from one end of the base, forming a right angle. The entire component appears to be a single molded or machined piece, likely used as a latch or mechanical actuator.'
